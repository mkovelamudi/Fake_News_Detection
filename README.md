# Project Title: Fake_News_Detection
CMPE 255 Project

## Idea
Include a clear description of the problem and the approach you have identified to solve it
Over the years the internet has become available in nearly every corner of the world which means
almost everyone is able to see news across the world. The accessibility of the internet has also
made it so news can be posted by politicians, news channels, or even common civilians. This level
of accessibility has made checking authenticity crucial, because the spread of misinformation has
been a real concern in today’s times due to people trying to push propaganda or their own political
agendas. The measure of authenticity of the news posted online cannot be definitively measured,
since the manual classification of news is tedious and time-consuming, and is also subject to bias.
Our approach to solving this issue of fake news is to take a large data set of both fake and real news
articles and derive a model that should be able to predict if other news articles are fake or not.

## Description of steps:
1. Applying preprocessing to dataset(s)
2. Exploring/Visualizing processed data
3. Exploratory data analysis and data wrangling
4. Applying different algorithms to data e.g. Random forest, Ensemble Methods, NLP ,etc...
5. Fitting the model in the appropriate algorithms
6. Test the data set with the trained model
7. Use trained model to predict authenticity of new data
8. [If time allows] Insert model into application that would allow new news articles to be
categorized as either fake news or real news
